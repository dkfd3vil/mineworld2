I wanna let you guys know that the project isnt dead.
Iam working really hard on this branch and ill give you guys a little heads-up:

Upcoming Features:

Build-in LUA Engine (To customize the way how you like it)
Variable mapsize (No more 64 by 64 maps)
Mapgeneration on seed (so if you liked the map you can reenter the number)

Lots more but these are the major 3



I would love to hear any suggestions
